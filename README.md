# User Management System

A full-stack user management system with authentication and authorization, built with Next.js, NestJS, and PostgreSQL.

## Quick Start

Run the entire application with a single command:

```bash
# Install dependencies and start both frontend and backend
npm install && npm run dev
```

This will:
1. Install all dependencies
2. Start the backend server on `http://localhost:5000`
3. Start the frontend development server on `http://localhost:3000`

> **Note**: Make sure you have set up your `.env` file and database before running (see below).

---

## Detailed Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

From the monorepo root:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install dependencies for both frontend and backend using workspaces.

---

### 2. Set up environment variables

- Create a `.env` file in `apps/backend/` with your database and JWT secret:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

---

### 3. Run database migrations

From the backend folder:

```sh
cd apps/backend
npm run prisma:migrate
```

---

### 4. Generate Prisma client

```sh
npm run prisma:generate
```

---

### 5. Start the backend server

```sh
npm run dev --workspace=apps/backend
```

Backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

---

### 6. Start the frontend server

From the monorepo root:

```sh
npm run dev --workspace=apps/frontend
```

Frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### 7. Access the application

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser for the frontend.
- Backend API is at [http://localhost:5000/api](http://localhost:5000/api).

---

### 8. Default accounts

- Register a new user via the frontend `/auth/signup`.
- To create an admin, set `role: "ADMIN"` in the database manually or extend the registration form.

---

### 9. Useful scripts

- **Backend:**
  - `npm run prisma:studio` (open Prisma Studio for DB management)
  - `npm run start --workspace=apps/backend` (start backend in production mode)
- **Frontend:**
  - `npm run build --workspace=apps/frontend` (build frontend for production)
  - `npm run start --workspace=apps/frontend` (start frontend in production mode)

---

## ðŸš€ Single Command Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to run everything with a single command after the initial setup:

```bash
# From the project root
npm run dev
```

This uses the workspace configuration to start both frontend and backend concurrently.

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

- Make sure PostgreSQL is running and accessible.
- Check `.env` values if you get connection/auth errors.
